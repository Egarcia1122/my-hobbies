   <p>My first favorite hobbie is to play the trombone. I play my instrument everyday for usually 2-3 hours. The main genre i play is jazz music and some classical. I love this hobbie because it allows me to express myself to people and let them know that i am trying to touch them with my music. Dont get me wrong this is very difficult because you have to be able to read note, play in pitch, and many more tasks.  </p>

    <p>My next favorite hobbie is playing baseball. I usually play 5 times a week for about 1-2 hours. The position i play is outfield and infield and sometimes catcher. I love this hobbie because your always doing something in baseball and the games are full of intensity and fun. The people I play baseball with is my team and i would say were pretty good due to many championships that we have won in the past seasons. In overall, these are my favorite hobbies because they include skill and lots of fun.</p>
